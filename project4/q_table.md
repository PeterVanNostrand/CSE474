# Q-Table

The following tables are generated by running the include Jupyter e file. [Action Probabilities](#action-probabilities) represents the probability of performing a given action based upon the state indicated by the row, col pair. [Actions by State](#actions-by-state) represents the most likely action given the current state, as the most likely action is the one performed this represents the final decision matrix of the trained q-learning agent.
